<!-- Provides forward and inverse kinematics using the generic arm_kinematics
     package from urdf_tools. This is the easiest way to provide FK and IK,
     but it is rather slow. Two alternatives could be implemented:
     - Wrap the KNI library; advantage: already optimized for Katana arm; 
       disadvantage: a real Katana arm has to be running, doesn't work in 
       Gazebo
     - use the OpenRave ikfast module; advantage: blazing fast; disadvantage:
       some work to implement
